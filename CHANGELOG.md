# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Guild leader elections (`initGuildLeaderVote`, `voteForGuildLeader`) with majority-based resolution and new `guild_leader_votes` table
- Release guild artifacts for premium currency (`releaseArtifact`)
- Decline guild invitations with 72h expiry check
- Claim guild dungeon battle rewards (gold + optional item)
- Claim items attached to messages (`claimMessageItems`)
- Change account email with password verification
- Account deletion with full cascade cleanup
- Stat redistribution (`reskillCharacterStats`)
- `itemPatternSelected` stub (SWF notification, no action needed)

### Fixed
- `Config::get()` crashes in `releaseArtifact`, `voteForGuildLeader`, and `reskillCharacterStats` when config keys don't exist yet (replaced `?: default` with 2nd argument)

### Documentation
- Full SWF compatibility report (`SWF_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md`): 234 client actions cross-referenced against 171 server handlers, 86% coverage, prioritized list of 28 remaining actions
- README rewritten with feature tables, architecture diagram, install guide, and roadmap

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Slot machine fully working (updated expired event dates to 2024-2030)
- Slot machine room handlers (`addUserToSlotmachineRoom`, `removeUserFromSlotmachineRoom`)
- All 7 reward types: coins, XP, stat points, quest energy, training, boosters, items. Sidekick symbol falls back to coins since the SWF dialog doesn't handle it
- Item rewards generate random equipment on symbol 2, quality scales with spin result
- Booster rewards on symbol 3 with 3 tiers, stacks with active boosters
- World boss reworked to two-step flow: `checkForWorldbossAttackComplete` runs the actual fight, `finishWorldbossAttack` just returns the result
- `abortWorldbossAttack` and `instantFinishWorldbossAttack` handlers
- Pending world boss attack now persists across page refresh (included in login response)
- Changed world boss identifier to `olympia_event_stage2` (the old one had no CDN translations)

### Fixed
- Slot machine always winning (leftover debug values instead of `mt_rand`)
- Slot quality wasn't tied to reel results. Now 3-match = quality 3, 2-match = quality 2, else quality 1
- Slot chat showing "NaN" (`json_decode` without `true` returns stdClass, `current()` on that gives false)
- Slot chat JSON parse error in SWF (`syncSlotmachineChat` was sending PHP object, not JSON string)
- Double-spin exploit: added `GET_LOCK` + `countCurrentSpins` check to cover the ~7-9s animation window where the SWF briefly re-enables the button
- World boss attack crash (`profileBHitPoints` on null): Battle records were missing profile stats fields
- Second world boss attack failing because the first attack's dialog never opened (blocked by the profileB crash)
- `finishWorldbossAttack` was running a second fight on completed attacks, doubling damage. Also: SWF sends `worldboss_event_id`, not `worldboss_attack_id`
- World boss attack stuck after changing language (login response was missing `worldboss_attack` key)
- World boss reward totals not updating between attacks (handlers now return full `worldboss_event_character_data`)
- `process-tournament.php end` crashing on `fetchAll()`: BIGINT UNSIGNED underflow when honor decreased during tournament. Fixed with `GREATEST(0, CAST(... AS SIGNED))`
- Tournament guild leaderboard expecting short keys (`r`, `n`, `v`, `ebs`, etc.) but getting full column names
- Same UNSIGNED underflow in character tournament rankings

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- Admin Items page is now a read-only catalog of all 779 item templates from GameSettings (search, filter by type/quality/pattern, pagination)
- Admin Characters: items section categorized into Equipped, Bag, Shop, Bank
- "Give Item" replaces old "Create Item" on character edit (picks from template catalog, auto-generates stats, bag or bank destination)
- Removed `admin/views/items/create.php`

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Messages not sending: `validMSG()` regex was missing the `/u` modifier for Unicode `\p{P}`, so `preg_replace` returned NULL on PHP 8.x
- `sendMessage` response: `messages_character_info` changed to dictionary keyed by character ID (was flat object, SWF expects dict)
- Admin message compose double-submit
- Duel/league stamina regeneration going over maximum

### Security
- Replaced `addslashes()` with prepared statements in all admin search queries
- Admin character edit: parameterized UPDATE instead of string building
- All destructive admin actions (ban, delete, etc.) now require POST + CSRF token instead of GET links

### Changed
- Removed dead Inventory and Battles entries from admin sidebar

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-12

- Admin message send triggers `syncGame` push to recipient

- New DB tables: `email_queue`, `email_log`, `password_reset_tokens`, `collected_goals`, `herobook_objectives`, `goal_pending_items`, `pattern_items`, `worldboss_event`, `worldboss_attack`, `worldboss_reward`, `tournaments`, `tournament_snapshots`, `tournament_rewards`
- Goal tracking for 44 new goals across sewing, costumes, dungeons, surprise box, world boss, tournaments

### Changed
- All URLs point to `http://localhost/` for local dev
- `resource_cdn` uses local CDN proxy instead of direct Akamai
- `url_support` opens local forgot-password page
- Added `payment_price_overwrite` to extended config (required by SWF payment dialog)
- `game.php` loads Ruffle CDN, language switcher, socketProxy config
- `countdown.php` rewritten with multi-language support
- Replaced piggyback `new_messages` HTTP response with socket push
- Goal coin formula matches SWF: `coinsPerTime(level) * base * factor * time + pow(level, exp)`
- Quest energy from goals adds directly without capping
- Enabled `herobook_enabled` and `tournaments_enabled` in GameSettings
- `loginUser` and `createCharacter` return dynamic `tournament_end_timestamp`
- Re-enabled guild dungeon loading in `Guild.php`

### Fixed
- JSON responses corrupted by PHP 8.x deprecation warnings (Hydrahon dynamic properties)
